# Animal-Adoption-Site
My first practice site. An animal adoption shelter. 

This is my first time working on my own project. I decided to act as if I am creating a website for an animal shelter. 
At the top is the header, then the navigation bar. 
After that will be a carousel of photos. 
Below that will be two call to action cards. 
Below the cards will be a bar with photos and links to pages where customers can see which animals are available. 
And, finally the footer.
